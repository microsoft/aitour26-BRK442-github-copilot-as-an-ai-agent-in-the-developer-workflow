### Prompts üí¨

********
This great but each product entry also needs a category drop down list. Create a drop down list with the following fields and also show this on each product entry.

- Electrical
- Garden & Outdoor
- Hand tools
- Hardware
- Lumber & Building materials
- Paint & Finishes
- Plumbing
- Power tools
- Storage & organization

Show screenshots of this working and do not include any actual product names. Keep the test data previously used.

### Talking points üéô
1. Coding agent can be prompted to make changes to the PR (human in the loop)
2. Now you need to specify in comments by @‚Äôting copilot when you want it to act on the feedback
3. **Human-in-the-Loop:** Demonstrate how to provide feedback to GitHub Copilot and that all external requests require human review (continue in session/workspace/always allow button in Copilot Chat)
