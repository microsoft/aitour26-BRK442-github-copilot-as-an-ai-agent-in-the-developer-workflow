## Talking points ðŸŽ™

1. Adding a SQLite database allows for data persistence, which is crucial for applications that require state management across sessions.
2. For this demo, we are using SQLite, a lightweight solution that can be easily integrated without the overhead of a full-fledged database server, but this approach can be adapted for other more robust databases as needed.
