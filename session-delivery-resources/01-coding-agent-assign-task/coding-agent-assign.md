## Talking points 🎙️

1. **Issue Scoping:** GitHub issues need to be well-defined for Coding Agent success
2. **Premium Requests:** Each Coding Agent run uses 1 premium request
3. **Processing Time:** Coding Agent tasks take several minutes depending on complexity (but are prone to taking much longer)
4. **Session Logs:** All Coding Agent steps are captured in session logs
